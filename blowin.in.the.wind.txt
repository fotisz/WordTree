How many roads must a man walk down, before they call him a man
How many seas must a white dove sail, before she sleeps in the sand
How many times must the cannonballs fly, before they are forever banned
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

How many years can a mountain exist, before it is washed to the sea
how many years can some people exist, before they're allowed to be free
how many times can a man turn his head, pretending he just doesn't see
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

How many times must a man look up,
before he can see the sky
How many years must one man have,
before he can hear people cry
How many deaths will it take till he knows
too many people have died
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
